## Food Classification Using Vision Transformers üçïü•óüç£

### Overview
- Leveraging **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** to classify diverse food types from images.
- Model trained on a curated food image dataset, aiming for high accuracy in recognizing various categories.

### Key Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained ViT models to enhance accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes techniques to improve model generalization and handle diverse image conditions.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Supports loading the trained model to classify new food images in real-time.

### Model & Dataset
- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer with self-attention for complex spatial relationships in food images.
- **Dataset**: Diverse categories with preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

### Results & Future Work
- Comprehensive evaluation 
- Plans to expand categories, explore advanced transformer variants, and optimize for mobile deployment.
